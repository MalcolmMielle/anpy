Introduction
============

Why ?
-----

Assemblee-nationale.fr website provide html which is so horrible that you will get some nightmare if you want to
parse it.

More recently, Assemblee-nationale.fr gave birth to a very interesting website data.assemblee-nationale.fr
whose goal was to provide Open Data from Assemblee-nationale.fr. Unfortunately, data models are not provided and it's
a pain to process their xml files. Moreover, it can be very useful to live process new changes on Assemble-nationale.fr
and be able to get immedialetely updated versions of french laws.


That's why we need a simple API to get data from Assemblee-nationale.fr
