ANpy is developed on GitHub, where the code is
`always available <https://github.com/regardscitoyens/anpy>`_.

You can either clone the public repository::

Once you have a copy of the source, you can embed it in your own Python
package, or install it into your site-packages easily::

    $ python setup.py install
